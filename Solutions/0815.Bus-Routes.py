815. Bus Routes

We have a list of bus routes. Each routes[i] is a bus route that the i-th bus repeats forever. 
For example if routes[0] = [1, 5, 7], this means that the first bus (0-th indexed) travels in the sequence 1->5->7->1->5->7->1->... forever.

We start at bus stop S (initially not on a bus), and we want to go to bus stop T. 
Travelling by buses only, what is the least number of buses we must take to reach our destination? Return -1 if it is not possible.

Example:
Input: 
routes = [[1, 2, 7], [3, 6, 7]]
S = 1
T = 6
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The best strategy is take the first bus to the bus stop 7, then take the second bus to the bus stop 6.
